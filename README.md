# Stat323Final
Stat323 Final Project. Working with Yelp Review Data, and performing sentiment analysis and other NLP to un-bias reviews within Yelp. Final project includes a Shiny application that will allow the user to analyze the biases present in the reviews for certain restaurants in the data set. 

##Instructions
Run `Final_Project.Rmd` to create files `all.csv`, `groups.csv`, and `model_coefficients.html`. (Note, this will take a long time, approximately 16 hours). 
Run `Shiny.Rmd` after, which uses those files, to run the shiny application.
